Charity is more than mere donation<br/>
Art more than paint on canvas<br/>
Liberty not a gift, but a sensation<br/>
<br/>

Our world is bursting of desperate souls and empty stomachs. <br/>
Donations of money and food are abundant. <br/>
Hunger can take many shapes, and a 
starving imagination is enough to weaken any man.

Naturally, creativity cannot be donated, it must arise from within.<br/>
 All one can do is provide an opportunity.<br/> 
This we can do.    <br/>
<br/>

Let us tell you how we discovered
the new generation of artists.<br/>

Have a look at our project.</p>
