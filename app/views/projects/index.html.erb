    <br />
    <br />
    We aim to eradicate the notion of charity being a linear and blind transaction. We wish to craft a sort of cirle. A cycle large enough to host beuty, independence as well as funds.
   <br /> 
    <br />
    However, we are not to outline this circle.
   <br /> 
    <br />
    Let us tell you how we discovered the new generation of artists.
   <br /> 
    <br />
    We are Fredrik BÃ¤ck, Lucas Lennig and Daniel Leksell. We want to introduce to you our new project. A project with heart.
